A Comprehensive Flight Arrival and Delay Analysis System

Project Description:

The aim of this project is to develop a dashboard for flight arrival and delay analysis using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The dashboard will provide insights on flight arrival times, delays, and their causes, enabling users to make informed decisions.

Data Collection:
The first step in this project is to collect flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) for a specific time period. The data will include flight arrival times, delays, flight path, weather information, and other related variables.

Data Pre-processing:
Once the data is collected, it will be pre-processed to remove any irrelevant information, handle missing values, and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis. The pre-processing will also include feature engineering to extract meaningful information from the data.

Data Analysis:
The pre-processed data will be analyzed to identify trends and patterns in flight arrival times, delays, and their causes. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Dashboard Development:
Once the data analysis and machine learning are completed, a dashboard will be developed using a visualization tool such as Tableau. The dashboard will display real-time data on flight arrival times, delays, and their causes. It will also provide predictive insights on future delays, enabling users to make informed decisions.

Conclusion:
The developed dashboard will enable airline companies and airport authorities to analyze flight data in real-time and make informed decisions to improve the overall performance of the aviation industry. The accurate delay prediction algorithm integrated into the dashboard will be a useful tool in reducing flight delays and improving customer satisfaction.
